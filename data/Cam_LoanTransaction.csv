As the candidate won his primary election and is unopposed for the general election, as instructed by Tracy Litrel at the Office of NM Secretary of State and with the candidated request, I am paying the remaining bank account amount to the candidate as payment to his loan and will forgive the remaining balance of his loan(s).  The remaining balance of the bank account in the amount of $633.43 was paid to Richard Silva in the form of a cashier's check serial# 0538805081 account# 4861-505659 on September 2, 2010.  The bank account's balance is now zero and subsequently has been closed.  This account is no longer needed and no further reporting is required as instructed by the Office of NM Secretary of State personnel (Tracy Litrel email:tracy@sos.nm.state 505-476-0354)   Closed bank account 644.19; paid 10.76 service charge for 4 months of 2.50 and tax .19 totally 10.76.  9/13/2010 Attempted to call SOS with no answer.  System is not updating transactions and won't allow me to submit report.  check on Primary Report 4 of $50.00 couldn't be removed / amended to fix balance.  9/14/2010 talked with Tracy at SOS and was able to successfully amend Primary Report 4 to remove check #1002 expenditure of 50.00 to Cecelia Archuleta because she wished to not be paid for her help.  This changed the Primary Report 4 closing balance to $644.19.  Now Amending General Report 1 to add the bank service charge expenditure of $10.76 and changing amount paid to candidate's loan from $594.19 to actual cashier check amount of 633.43.  This reflects the actual state of the bank account as being closed as well as providing a zero balance on the campaign account.  The final report will also be submitted tonight and no further reporting is needed per discussion with SOS rep Tracy Litrel's instructions.     ",1,2,17139,

As the candidate won his primary election and is unopposed for the general election, as instructed by Tracy Litrel at the Office of NM Secretary of State and with the candidated request, I am paying the remaining bank account amount to the candidate as payment to his loan and will forgive the remaining balance of his loan(s).  The remaining balance of the bank account in the amount of $633.43 was paid to Richard Silva in the form of a cashier's check serial# 0538805081 account# 4861-505659 on September 2, 2010.  The bank account's balance is now zero and subsequently has been closed.  This account is no longer needed and no further reporting is required as instructed by the Office of NM Secretary of State personnel (Tracy Litrel email:tracy@sos.nm.state 505-476-0354)   Closed bank account 644.19; paid 10.76 service charge for 4 months of 2.50 and tax .19 totally 10.76.  9/13/2010 Attempted to call SOS with no answer.  System is not updating transactions and won't allow me to submit report.  check on Primary Report 4 of $50.00 couldn't be removed / amended to fix balance.  9/14/2010 talked with Tracy at SOS and was able to successfully amend Primary Report 4 to remove check #1002 expenditure of 50.00 to Cecelia Archuleta because she wished to not be paid for her help.  This changed the Primary Report 4 closing balance to $644.19.  Now Amending General Report 1 to add the bank service charge expenditure of $10.76 and changing amount paid to candidate's loan from $594.19 to actual cashier check amount of 633.43.  This reflects the actual state of the bank account as being closed as well as providing a zero balance on the campaign account.  The final report will also be submitted tonight and no further reporting is needed per discussion with SOS rep Tracy Litrel's instructions.     ",1,1,18751,
